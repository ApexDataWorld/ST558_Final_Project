## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
health_data <- read_csv("data/diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv")
head(health_data)
```

```{r}
health_data |>
  is.na() |>
  colSums()
```

```{r}
attributes(health_data)$spec
```

```{r}
summary(health_data)
```

```{r}
health_data <- health_data |>

## Welcome

This site presents an analysis of the **Diabetes Health Indicators** dataset from the 2015 BRFSS survey.\
The main outcome of interest is `Diabetes_binary`, which indicates whether a respondent has diabetes or not.

This project has two main parts:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – understanding the data, distributions, and relationships.\
2.  **Modeling** – building and comparing predictive models (classification tree and random forest) using the **tidymodels** framework.

## Pages

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA page:

-   Describes the dataset and key variables.
-   Recodes variables into meaningful factor levels.
-   Explores diabetes prevalence overall and across groups (example., sex, BMI, general health).
-   Summarizes numeric variables and examines correlations.

### 2. Modeling

The Modeling page:

-   Splits the data into training (70%) and test (30%) sets with stratification on `Diabetes_binary`.
-   Defines a common **recipe** for pre processing predictors.
-   Fits and tunes:
    -   A **classification tree**
    -   A **random forest**
-   Uses **5 fold cross validation** with **log loss** and **accuracy** to select the best model in each family.
-   Compares the final models on the test set and selects an overall “winner” for deployment as an API.

## Notes

-   The final selected model from the Modeling page is used in a separate `.R` file to define a **Plumber API**, which is then packaged in a **Docker** image for deployment.
